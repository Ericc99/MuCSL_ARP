The platform is consisted of three major, some minor components and other peripheral hardware controllers.

- Django Backend
- Vue Frontend

## Future Plans

<u>2025-01-03</u>
Happy new year.

The platform will soon be transfered to ROS2 environment, as it can provide strong support for such robotic projects. 

The transition will not be quite smooth but I surly hope it can be done before Mid January 2025.
